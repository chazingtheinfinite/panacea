# The Panacea Project: Prototype

The hosted implementation can be found [here](http://bioinf.sce.carleton.ca/panacea/prototype/)!

This is the framework of a partially-functional prototype serving as a proof-of-concept for an implementation of The Panacea Project.
It contains the basics functionality expected of a web service such as registration, login, UI navigation, and a basic UI/UX interface.

## Contributions:
* Minimum viable implementation of a functional web service
* Implementation of the proof-of-concept neural network

Implements the following technologies:
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Modelling Unstructured Clinical Notes
* Stacked Denoising Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction
* Multi-Layer Perceptron to Predict the Likelihood accross all ICD9 Codes
* Reciprocal Perspective for Post-Processing the Predictions to Improve Prediction Accuracty
