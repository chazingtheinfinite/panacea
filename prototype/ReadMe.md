# The Panacea Project: Prototype

The hosted implementation can be found [here](http://bioinf.sce.carleton.ca/panacea/prototype/)!

This is the framework of a partially-functional prototype serving as a proof-of-concept for an implementation of The Panacea Project.
It contains the basics functionality expected of a web service such as registration, login, UI navigation, and a basic UI/UX interface.
