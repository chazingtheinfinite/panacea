# The Panacea Project
The Panacea Project looks to develop and interate a highly accurate machine learning model capable of predicting the probability that any one patient has any disease (using ICD9 codes). It looks to merge concepts of public/population health with personalized medicine through the Reciprocal Perspective framework.

Implements the following technologies:
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Modelling Unstructured Clinical Notes
* Stacked Denoising Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction
* Multi-Layer Perceptron to Predict the Likelihood accross all ICD9 Codes
* Reciprocal Perspective for Post-Processing the Predictions to Improve Prediction Accuracty
